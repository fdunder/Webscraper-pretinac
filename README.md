# Webscraper-pretinac

Because students/my colleagues have to manually check the university website every time they post something important to us, this project was created to web scrape information from it.

Python, Selenium, and Discord were utilized.

With the command !pretinac, the Discord bot logs in and sends a message to the university discord group with the most up-to-date information related to our studies.

Because the university website has listed information for all university programs, I created filters for each subject our path contains, ensuring that only information relevant to our program is displayed.
