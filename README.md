# Webscraper-pretinac

Because students have to manually check the university website every time they post something important to us, this project was created to web scrape information from it.

Python, Selenium, and Discord were utilized.

With the command !pretinac, the Discord bot logs in and sends a message to the university discord group with the most up-to-date information on our program.

Because the university website has information for all programs, I created filters for each subject our path contains, ensuring that only information relevant to our program is displayed.
